📊 Human Resources Analytics Dashboard

A Complete Workforce Intelligence Solution

🧩 Project Overview

This project consists of two interactive Human Resources dashboards designed to provide both high-level strategic insights and employee-level operational analysis.
The dashboards help HR leaders and business stakeholders make data-driven decisions related to hiring, retention, compensation, workforce diversity, and performance management.

🖥️ Dashboard 1: HR Overview & Strategic Insights
🎯 Objective

To provide a 360-degree overview of the organization’s workforce, enabling leadership to quickly understand overall employee health, demographics, attrition, income patterns, and departmental performance.

📌 Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle with:

Tracking hiring vs attrition trends

Understanding department-wise workforce distribution

Monitoring demographics, diversity, and performance

Aligning salary structures with education, age, and role

Without a centralized analytics view, HR decisions become reactive instead of strategic.

🔍 Key Insights
👥 Workforce Summary

Total Hired: 902

Active Employees: 804

Terminated Employees: 98

➡️ Attrition is present but controlled, indicating overall workforce stability.

🏢 Department Analysis

Sales & Customer Service show moderate attrition → performance-driven roles

HR & Finance demonstrate strong stability

➡️ Attrition is department-specific, not organization-wide.

⚥ Gender Distribution

Male: 55%

Female: 45%

➡️ Workforce is relatively balanced, though leadership roles can improve gender diversity.

🎓 Education & Age Trends

Dominant age group: 25–44 years → productive working population

🖥️ Dashboard 2: Employee-Level HR Analytics
🎯 Objective

To provide granular, drill-down visibility into individual employee records, enabling operational HR teams to manage workforce data efficiently.

📌 Problem Statement

HR teams often lack:

A unified view of employee data

Flexible filters for salary, tenure, location, and status

Quick identification of early attrition and pay inconsistencies

Manual tracking increases errors, delays, and compliance risks.

🔍 Key Insights
